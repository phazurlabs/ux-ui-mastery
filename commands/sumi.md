# Sumi — Your Design Intelligence System

Welcome to Sumi v4.0.0. 37 commands. 43 skills. Vibe coded slop into visual cuisine.

**New here?** Run `/start` instead. It asks one question and routes you — no need to read this map.

## Quick Start

```
# The fast track — style it, build it, ship it
/style [sector]  →  /screen [type]  →  /fix  →  ship

# The quality track — fix slop, prove it, ship it
/fix  →  /before-after  →  /grade  →  ship

# The full track — plan, design, review, ship
/brief  →  /style  →  /screen  →  /roast  →  /fix  →  /preflight
```

## Renamed in v4.0.0

Sumi 3.1.0 and Chef Sumi were one lineage that had forked. v4.0.0 merges them.
Where both shipped a command for the same job, the richer one survived. If you
were using a 3.1.0 name, here is where it went:

| 3.1.0 name | Now |
|---|---|
| `/accessibility-check` | `/a11y` |
| `/ux-audit` | `/audit` |
| `/design-review` | `/audit` (see its domain roll-up section) |
| `/cognitive-check` | `/audit cognitive` |
| `/design-critique` | `/roast` |
| `/component-build` | `/component` |
| `/generate-design-tokens` | `/tokens` |
| `/ux-metrics-plan` | `/measure` |
| `/figma-to-code` | `/figma` |
| `/ai-ux-audit` | `/ai-audit` |


## Starter Recipes

One word. Zero config. Complete visual identity.

## Workflows by Goal

**"Fix my AI-generated code"**
`/fix` → `/before-after`

**"Build a screen fast"**
`/style [sector]` → `/screen [type]`

**"Get a design quality score"**
`/grade` (or `/grade vs stripe`)

**"Complete design system"**
`/style` → `/tokens` → `/screen` → `/component`

**"Review existing design"**
`/audit` → `/roast` → `/a11y` → `/grade`

**"Start from scratch"**
`/brief` → `/research` → `/style` → `/screen`

**"Ship by Friday"**
`/style` → `/screen` → `/fix` → `/qa` → `/preflight`

**"Scan my whole codebase"**
`/qa project`

## What's New in v4.0.0

- **Anti-Slop Engine** (`/fix`) — 60+ detection patterns, full code transformation. Turns AI-generated UI into production quality.
- **Design Quality Score** (`/grade`) — 0-100 Lighthouse-style scoring with badge generation. Benchmark against any product.
- **Before/After** (`/before-after`) — Visual proof of design transformation with side-by-side comparison.
- **Platform-Aware Generation** — `/screen` and `/component` auto-detect iOS/Android/web and generate platform-native code.
- **Starter Recipes** — 10 zero-config design systems. One word each. Instant visual identity.
- **Project-Wide QA** — `/qa project` scans entire codebase for design drift and inconsistency.
- **Cognitive Load Analysis** — `/audit` now includes Laws of UX and Gestalt evaluation alongside Nielsen's heuristics.
- **Design Memory v2** — Auto-detects existing Tailwind config and CSS custom properties. `.sumi/` carries context across all commands.
- **WCAG Auto-Fix** — `/a11y fix` generates corrected code for every accessibility finding.
- **AI Slop Detection** — `/roast` and `/audit` now flag AI-generated UI patterns (default spacing, placeholder copy, generic icons).

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with `/style`**. Takes 2 minutes, makes everything 10x better.
2. **Run `/fix` on any AI-generated code**. It's the fastest path to production quality.
3. **Use `/grade` before every PR**. If it scores below 70, run `/fix`.
4. **The more context you give, the better the output**. Paste screenshots, code, URLs, Figma exports.
5. **Commands compose**. `/style` → `/screen` → `/fix` → `/grade` builds on each step.
6. **Design memory carries across commands**. Run `/style` once, benefit everywhere.
7. **Be specific about screen types**. `/screen dashboard` beats `/screen`. `/screen settings mobile iOS` beats `/screen settings`.
8. **REVIEW commands work on anything**. Paste a screenshot, a URL, a code snippet, a Figma export.

Start building. `/style [your sector]` is a good first move. Or paste your code and run `/fix`.
